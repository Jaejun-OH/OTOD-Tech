            <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
         <p>MyCarPal App</p>
<p>Imagine the perfect middle ground of driving by yourself and taking public transport. Imagine an app you log into where you can find other 
  users who want to travel to the same destination as you - whether it is a regular commute into your local business centre for work or one-off trip down to the coast to visit family or friends or both. MyCarPal App is a cost efficient, user friendly app which we are offering on both the Android and IOS operating systems. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ride sharing apps out there but none that are future thinking while bringing people together to share the cost of their travel requirements, whilst also reducing our environmental footprint on this planet. </p>
<p>We want the MyCarPal app to be helping - helping you, your friends and family, by organising your regular commutes, while sharing the cost. Making things less complicated and allowing you to go in your own direction. Putting your mind at ease with safety and security at the heart of its design. helping to cut your carbon footprint, it's a win win for everyone.</p>
<p>Imagine MyCarPal App. </p>
             <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
            <p>But why go with the MyCarPal app when there are so many other ride-sharing apps already on the market? Uber and Lyft are more replacement taxi services that are based around profit and price-fixing. At the other end of the scale, owning your own car can be very expensive to run and maintain, not to mention the vehicle's outright purchase price. Maybe you don't even need the use of a car more than once or twice a year. You can also think of the environmental footprint the use of a vehicle has. Cars emit greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's public transport. It's not easy to use, confusing timetables, costly, and safety is always a problem, and to top it off, it doesn't always go in the direction you're after.</p>
<p>We see many reasons why customers would choose our app over others and ultimately, we will make a difference.</p>
                        <p></p>
            <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
          <p></p>
 
            <p>When the user first downloads MyCarPal App, they must register their name, phone number, email, license details and payment details.&nbsp; These will then be verified.&nbsp; You can then choose your username.When using the application, you will only need to share the relevant information with other users,&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;"Blue Nissan - clean" all other information will be kept private.&nbsp;Once they have been verified, the user can scroll through local boards, looking for users travelling in the same direction. They will be able to filter to add your destination, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can also make a post and flag the date and time they are travelling, for example, a trip to Sydney from Melbourne on Monday the 5/4 leaving at 9 am and looking for two passengers. You post your trip and can wait for other people to reply. When they answer, you can accept the share and arrange a pick-up point. Suppose you are a user looking for about the same date and destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
            <p> In that case, you will receive a notification something like this&nbsp;Hi user Benny82&nbsp;is looking to travel from Sydney to Melbourne on 5/4, leaving at 9 am in your local area. Would you like to accept the ride? The user can then accept user Benny82's ride and negotiate a price. The App adjusts prices for the two parties. The App can also have a hitchhiker function. For example, a person can be driving from Melbourne to Sydney and receive a thumbs up notification going my way?</p>

            <p>The App can use&nbsp;people's&nbsp;geolocation to send notifications to people in the area. If the driver opens the notification, they'll see the information from the person looking to hitchhike&nbsp;user Benny82&rsquo;s&nbsp;is hitchhiking to Canberra. He's looking for a ride he's willing to compensate $25.During the ride, the App shows the driver's destination. If anyone feels unsafe at any time, they can be an emergency button, which they can press to report any abuse against the other users and even put them through to emergency services. Although we want people to have happy, safe trips, I feel&nbsp;it is essential to have an emergency feature. Once the ride has finished, the transaction will occur, and both driver and passenger go in separate directions. If it is&nbsp;a regular commute ride, both users can choose to set up a regular commute trip in the App.</p>
            <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
            <p>The technical requirements for the application do not seem to be so complicated and it could vary by the design of the app. Ideally, the MyCarPal application will be built as a mobile app because the user should be able to use it whenever or wherever they need to. Furthermore, mobile apps could use GPS to better obtain the geolocation data of the user that is necessary for operating the application. Nevertheless, web pages would still be very useful to introduce the application and to support customer services. </p>
            <p>
                When the app is designed to be a mobile app, it should be able to run by both android and iOS operating system. It could either be done by creating separate apps for each platform or to use a development software to build an app that can run by both operation systems. Android app could be developed by using popular Android IDEs such as Android Studio and Gradle in Kotlin or Java language. iOS software could use XCode and Apple Developer Tools by primarily using Swift or C language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, there are many software developments kit that can produce an app that is compatible with both android and iOS. Flutter could be a good option to choose because it enables a cross-platform app development to add/remove features and test them with reduced development time. </p>
            </p>
             <h3 id="tech">Tech Skills</h3>

             <center><img src="img/tech1.gif" alt="AV" width="560" height="445"></center>

          <p>The technical skills needed to develop the app are:  </p>
          <strong>Java for Android native apps </strong>
          <p>For the Android platform, the Java language is used, along with the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Google provides the Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin for the standard Eclipse IDE to support graphical layout definition and debugging.</p><br>

          <strong>Objective-C (Swift) for iOS native products</strong>
          <p>There are many reasons why Obj-C has retained such a solid foothold in the sphere of iOS development, but the strong features and characteristics of the language are certainly the main selling points. Being widely used for decades has earned Obj-C a solid place among the world’s leading programming languages. Furthermore, the extensive development that it has experienced over time has made it well-rounded, stable, and reliable.</p><br>

          <strong>HTML (CSS, JavaScript) for cross-platform mobile apps</strong>
          <p>When browsing the web, the pages that are viewed are just text documents sitting on someone else’s computer. The text in a typical web page is wrapped in HTML tags, which tell your browser about the structure of the document. With this information, the browser can decide how to display the information in a way that makes sense</p>



           <h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
          <p>The Outcome will be an app that is a user-friendly ride-sharing app helping customers travel more efficiently that runs on both android and iOS operating systems. That lets you choose the way you want to travel and the direction you want to travel, with a competitive flat fee cost structure that puts more profit into the user's wallets and the added benefit of saving money. An app that prioritises its users' safety and security, respecting its user's data privacy, giving people peace of mind when every they use our app. You'll be able to interact with your local community in a way that public transport does not allow. And most importantly, you'll be able to reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Users will have security and peace of mind that their travel needs are being met. No more fights about who is driving, where are we going, what time will we get there? All these questions are sorted out before you go anywhere.</p>
<p>Imagine your upfront costs for travelling already sorted. Imagine meeting people who live in the same area as you and being able to interact with your local community in a way that public transport does not allow.</p>
<p>Imagine MyCarpal App.</p>
