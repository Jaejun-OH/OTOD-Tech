<p><span data-contrast="none">When the user first downloads My Carpool App, they must register their name, phone number, email, license details and payment details.&nbsp; These will then be verified.&nbsp; You can then choose your username.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When using the application, you will only need to share the relevant information with other users,&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;"Blue Nissan - clean" all other information will be kept private.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Once they have been verified, the user can scroll through local boards, looking for users travelling in the same direction. They will be able to filter to add your destination, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can also make a post and flag the date and time they are travelling, for example, a trip to Sydney from Melbourne on Monday the 5/4 leaving at 9 am and looking for two passengers. You post your trip and can wait for other people to reply. When they answer, you can accept the share and arrange a pick-up point. Suppose you are a user looking for about the same date and destination.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In that case, you will receive a notification something like this&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">H</span><span data-contrast="none">i user Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is looking to travel from Sydney to Melbourne on 5/4, leaving at 9 am in your local area. Would you like to accept the ride? The user can then accept user Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82</span><span data-contrast="none">'s ride and negotiate a price. The App adjusts prices for the two parties. The App can also have a hitchhiker function. For example, a person can be driving from Melbourne to Sydney and receive a thumbs up notification going my way? The App can use&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">people's</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;geolocation to send notifications to people in the area. If the driver opens the notification, they'll see the information from the person looking to hitchhike&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">u</span><span data-contrast="none">ser Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82&rsquo;s</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is hitchhiking to Canberra. He's looking for a ride he's willing to compensate $25.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">During the ride, the App shows the driver's destination. If anyone feels unsafe at any time, they can be an emergency button, which they can press to report any abuse against the other users and even put them through to emergency services. Although we want people to have happy, safe trips, I feel&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">it is essential to have an emergency feature. Once the ride has finished, the transaction will occur, and both driver and passenger go in separate directions. If it is</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;a regular commute ride, both users can choose to set up a regular commute trip in the App.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>The technical requirements for the application do not seem to be so complicated and it could vary by the design of the app. Ideally, the carpool application will be built as a mobile app because the user should be able to use it whenever or wherever they need to. Furthermore, mobile apps could use GPS to better obtain the geolocation data of the user that is necessary for operating the application. Nevertheless, web pages would still be very useful to introduce the application and to support customer services. </p><br>
            <p>
                When the app is designed to be a mobile app, it should be able to run by both android and iOS operating system. It could either be done by creating separate apps for each platform or to use a development software to build an app that can run by both operation systems. Android app could be developed by using popular Android IDEs such as Android Studio and Gradle in Kotlin or Java language. iOS software could use XCode and Apple Developer Tools by primarily using Swift or C language.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Alternatively, there are many software developments kit that can produce an app that is compatible with both android and iOS. Flutter could be a good option to choose because it enables a cross-platform app development to add/remove features and test them with reduced development time. </p>

          <p>The technical skills needed to develop the app are:  </p>
          <strong>Java for Android native apps </strong>
          <p>For the Android platform, the Java language is used, along with the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Google provides the Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin for the standard Eclipse IDE to support graphical layout definition and debugging.</p><br>

          <strong>Objective-C (Swift) for iOS native products</strong>
          <p>There are many reasons why Obj-C has retained such a solid foothold in the sphere of iOS development, but the strong features and characteristics of the language are certainly the main selling points. Being widely used for decades has earned Obj-C a solid place among the world’s leading programming languages. Furthermore, the extensive development that it has experienced over time has made it well-rounded, stable, and reliable.</p><br>

          <strong>HTML (CSS, JavaScript) for cross-platform mobile apps</strong>
          <p>When browsing the web, the pages that are viewed are just text documents sitting on someone else’s computer. The text in a typical web page is wrapped in HTML tags, which tell your browser about the structure of the document. With this information, the browser can decide how to display the information in a way that makes sense</p>
