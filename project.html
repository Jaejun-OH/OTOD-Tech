            <p> Though my IT skills are only in the growth stage, I’ve always had an interest, specifically around web and app development, design and user experience fields. I love the idea of being able to think of a concept then by using code and design principles to create something that helps people, animals or the environment (or all three).
            </p>

            <p>My interest in IT became stronger in the past few years after I was given the opportunity to create a student website using WordPress. Even though to most IT professionals, that’s not much to write home about, it still allowed me to be creative and sparked my interest further in seeing what else the IT world had to offer. I then began to research IT careers, and this bought me to the idea of web and app design. I am also fascinated by AI and ML. I would love to build a robot dog one day...it's good to aim high.

            <p>RMIT was my first choice due to hearing great things about the level of industry ready learning and expertise of the tutors.

            <p>Description (Peter) 
When the user first downloads My Carpool App, they must register their name, phone number, email, license details and payment details.  These will then be verified.  You can then choose your username.  
When using the application, you will only need to share the relevant information with other users, e.g. "Blue Nissan - clean" all other information will be kept private. 
Once they have been verified, the user can scroll through local boards, looking for users travelling in the same direction. They will be able to filter to add your destination, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney. 
You can also make a post and flag the date and time they are travelling, for example, a trip to Sydney from Melbourne on Monday the 5/4 leaving at 9 am and looking for two passengers. You post your trip and can wait for other people to reply. When they answer, you can accept the share and arrange a pick-up point. Suppose you are a user looking for about the same date and destination.  
In that case, you will receive a notification something like this Hi user Benny82 is looking to travel from Sydney to Melbourne on 5/4, leaving at 9 am in your local area. Would you like to accept the ride? The user can then accept user Benny82's ride and negotiate a price. The App adjusts prices for the two parties. The App can also have a hitchhiker function. For example, a person can be driving from Melbourne to Sydney and receive a thumbs up notification going my way? The App can use people's geolocation to send notifications to people in the area. If the driver opens the notification, they'll see the information from the person looking to hitchhike user Benny82’s is hitchhiking to Canberra. He's looking for a ride he's willing to compensate $25.   
During the ride, the App shows the driver's destination. If anyone feels unsafe at any time, they can be an emergency button, which they can press to report any abuse against the other users and even put them through to emergency services. Although we want people to have happy, safe trips, I feel it is essential to have an emergency feature. Once the ride has finished, the transaction will occur, and both driver and passenger go in separate directions. If it is a regular commute ride, both users can choose to set up a regular commute trip in the App.
