<p>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</p>
<p>Reuben is an IT consultant, and he works for a company called Access HQ (Human quality). They help organisations improve the quality of their IT services for other companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.accesshq.com/about-us/">https://www.accesshq.com/about-us/ </a></p>
<p><strong>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </strong></p>
<p>As an IT consultant, Reuben interacts with a wide variety of people, a lot of IT professionals in his own company and IT professionals in other companies, and clients who have no expertise in IT at all. But the person most essential that he interacts with is the end-user (general public.) of the IT programs his company helps other companies to develop. They are at the core of everything his company does.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </strong></p>
<p>He spends a lot of time talking/communicating with others, selling his services to other companies, and putting together proposals. The proposals can be quite complex and take a lot of time for himself and his team to do, but they can lead to a lot of money for his company at the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>What aspect of their position is most challenging? </strong></p>
<p>Reuben fines that time management and his team's coordination is the most challenging part of his job. IT is not always a 9 to 5 job. Sometimes you have deadlines you have to meet or bugs that need fixing. All of which can be time-critical. While making sure you keep downtime for yourself to manage your headspace, keeping yourself balanced and productive.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These are the Interview questions with&nbsp;a brief summary&nbsp;of Reuben Korngold&rsquo;s answers please see the transcript for more details.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I had many different roles over the years, from software development, systems administration, software testing, project and portfolio management. These days, I&nbsp;works&nbsp;for a company called Access HQ as an IT consultant.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Please tell us about the industry you work in.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The organisation I work for helps other companies deliver high-quality large IT projects. My time is spent in a sales capacity, talking to different companies about what my company can help them improve on. We deal with a lot of various industries, everything from supply chains to Foxtel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">What other kinds of work do you have to do?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We also look at how our clients do business and work with them to set strategies and approaches that will allow them to focus on a quality outcome for their business and their end-user. We do this by running workshops bringing people together and building a shared understanding, concentrating on solving any problems that may arise.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I deal with many different people with different personalities, and one of the main ways we interact is through our program called Gantt. It helps keep everyone on track and organised. Some of the other roles we might deal with are procurement officers, selling consultants, solution architects, development managers, testing managers and various other people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the IT industry, you get some unique personalities. You&nbsp;have to&nbsp;sometimes negotiate with them and have the right conversations, particularly where we're focusing on quality. These can be tough conversations, especially when they feel they finished the job, but it doesn't meet the quality standards required, and that's a conversation you'll have to have with them. We work in a technical sphere, and there's a balance, knowing that a person doing a perfect job and getting it right within the constraints, importantly aligning to what customers want. Just because you built something brilliant doesn't mean it's what they wanted. Quality is so important in IT projects. Why?&nbsp; Because a lot of IT projects fail. And why do they fail because of lack of understanding and lack of proper management.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">What about your interactions with clients or investors?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have lots of different clients from pizza companies to governments. If you all consider the pizza companies, there's many of them, Pizza Hut, Domino's and others. They're all competing for your pizza dollars on a Friday night. And if The Pizza Hut websites down and the customer buys a Domino's Pizza instead, then Pizza Hut risk that customer not coming back. They may have enjoyed the Domino's Pizza, and next time, they'll buy a Domino's pizza instead. They know their website works anyway. It's also essential to manage the expectations of our clients. Some of them want unicorns at the lowest price possible and wanting everything done within the week when it&nbsp;actually would&nbsp;take a couple of months. Other clients are happy with a quality product within a reasonable budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I spend a lot of time talking and communicating with others, using tools like Microsoft teams, selling services to other companies, and putting together proposals. The proposals can be&nbsp;pretty complex, like a University assignment. They can have word limits and need diagrams. It can take a lot of time to do, and where time allows, it's essential to be consistent. The client should never know that more than one person has worked on the document. Especially considering it's representing the company and can make a lot of money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Every project and every client&nbsp;is&nbsp;different, so we always&nbsp;have to&nbsp;adapt. Sometimes you know the challenges can be Impossible. Sometimes the right thing to do is to say no. and help manage people's expectations. Tell them you need six months to do this. But all we have is six weeks.&nbsp;So&nbsp;let's see what we can do to improve. It's better to say no to the business, than take on bad business. Time management can also be challenging. IT projects rarely are a nine to five job, especially If you want to be successful. If you're building software and needs to be built by Friday, time is very important, things can run smoothly, and other times you have extra debugging to fix. It's necessary to be in the right headspace to do productive work, so it's keeping that balance and making sure to take some downtime for yourself to help you recharge.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I've got two for you,</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The first one, Y2K.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;From about 1950, software was designed to run on computers that had limited memory. To save space, they decided to use two digits for the year. Instead of 1990, they used. 90. It wasn't a problem until they started going from 31 December 99 to 1 January 00. It was a problem, especially on and calculating interest. So, we had about four years to fix the Y2K bug. There was a lot of work right across the world. I was involved in helping with repairs, and afterwards, people who weren't in IT said it was all false. Nothing broke, without realizing that people had spent years fixing the problem.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The second involved Game of Thrones and Foxtel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We got a call about six weeks before the last episode of Game of Thrones, and they asked if their system was going to perform. This was one of the jobs where we needed six months, not six weeks. They were expecting around 600,000 people to stream the episode simultaneously. It's never been done in Australia before, and many people told us we couldn't do it, but we did it anyway. I had to force it through. We're working with the Chief Operating Officer of Foxtel, who said Reuben, you tell me anybody who tells you no, and I don't care who they are. I'll make sure that they changed their answer to yes, so we had to work with many different companies. We looked at the whole thing end to end. When you log in, to the thumbnails images, there are all kinds of marketing systems at work. We learned that it doesn't just download the movie when you press play on one of those thumbnails. It streams it in tiny packets. It happens dynamically depending on your bandwidth, system, thousands of different things. We ended up testing about one terabit per second of traffic across the Internet. We got a warning letter from Amazon Web Services saying you were generating too much traffic. Telstra said no, they didn't want us to do it. The people from Foxtel said, you better do it, or we'll go sign up with Optus instead. There was a heap of different things that ended up happening. We tested the system five times, close to a million concurrent video streams, and the first test didn't work. We found a problem.&nbsp;This is why&nbsp;you test things repeatedly because you try it out, and things don't work. We made some fixes, and we tested it again and again. Until we got it right. If we hadn't have done all that work, Foxtel probably would have ended up with many unhappy customers getting upset in a world of pain because they couldn't watch their favourite TV show. They may have asked, why am I paying this company so much money for a subscription when I can't even use it. Ultimately it would mean people would have left them. They would have lost money. Instead, they had one of the best days of business they ever had, and instead of bad publicity, it was all good for them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Bonus question: What&rsquo;s the one program you could recommend us to learn that will help us get into the IT industry and that&rsquo;s in high demand?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I think technical skills are important, but technical skills alone it is not enough either. It's also really about attitude.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I would say at least two things technical skills and the right attitude. And the reason I say that is if you only know how to do one thing. You will struggle in the IT industry. But at least if you know multiple programming languages, you're adept at changing to a third one. So pretty much saying it's not about being able to perform any specific technology, but rather learning and adapting to a new one. When I was at Uni, I learned C and Pascal and COBOL as well. Now COBOL is still around in places like banks, government agencies, any slow-moving organisations. It's getting less and less. But again, if you're a COBOL programmer and you didn't move with the times, then you would probably be struggling for work right now. Every few years, there is always something new to learn. That's why a learning mindset is so important. It's much easier to adapt to the next greatest thing that comes along.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When the user first downloads My Carpool App, they must register their name, phone number, email, license details and payment details.&nbsp; These will then be verified.&nbsp; You can then choose your username.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When using the application, you will only need to share the relevant information with other users,&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;"Blue Nissan - clean" all other information will be kept private.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Once they have been verified, the user can scroll through local boards, looking for users travelling in the same direction. They will be able to filter to add your destination, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can also make a post and flag the date and time they are travelling, for example, a trip to Sydney from Melbourne on Monday the 5/4 leaving at 9 am and looking for two passengers. You post your trip and can wait for other people to reply. When they answer, you can accept the share and arrange a pick-up point. Suppose you are a user looking for about the same date and destination.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In that case, you will receive a notification something like this&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">H</span><span data-contrast="none">i user Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is looking to travel from Sydney to Melbourne on 5/4, leaving at 9 am in your local area. Would you like to accept the ride? The user can then accept user Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82</span><span data-contrast="none">'s ride and negotiate a price. The App adjusts prices for the two parties. The App can also have a hitchhiker function. For example, a person can be driving from Melbourne to Sydney and receive a thumbs up notification going my way? The App can use&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">people's</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;geolocation to send notifications to people in the area. If the driver opens the notification, they'll see the information from the person looking to hitchhike&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">u</span><span data-contrast="none">ser Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82&rsquo;s</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is hitchhiking to Canberra. He's looking for a ride he's willing to compensate $25.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">During the ride, the App shows the driver's destination. If anyone feels unsafe at any time, they can be an emergency button, which they can press to report any abuse against the other users and even put them through to emergency services. Although we want people to have happy, safe trips, I feel&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">it is essential to have an emergency feature. Once the ride has finished, the transaction will occur, and both driver and passenger go in separate directions. If it is</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;a regular commute ride, both users can choose to set up a regular commute trip in the App.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
