<p><span data-contrast="none">When the user first downloads My Carpool App, they must register their name, phone number, email, license details and payment details.&nbsp; These will then be verified.&nbsp; You can then choose your username.</span><span data-contrast="none">When using the application, you will only need to share the relevant information with other users,&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;"Blue Nissan - clean" all other information will be kept private.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Once they have been verified, the user can scroll through local boards, looking for users travelling in the same direction. They will be able to filter to add your destination, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">You can also make a post and flag the date and time they are travelling, for example, a trip to Sydney from Melbourne on Monday the 5/4 leaving at 9 am and looking for two passengers. You post your trip and can wait for other people to reply. When they answer, you can accept the share and arrange a pick-up point. Suppose you are a user looking for about the same date and destination.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In that case, you will receive a notification something like this&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">H</span><span data-contrast="none">i user Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is looking to travel from Sydney to Melbourne on 5/4, leaving at 9 am in your local area. Would you like to accept the ride? The user can then accept user Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82</span><span data-contrast="none">'s ride and negotiate a price. The App adjusts prices for the two parties. The App can also have a hitchhiker function. For example, a person can be driving from Melbourne to Sydney and receive a thumbs up notification going my way? The App can use&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">people's</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;geolocation to send notifications to people in the area. If the driver opens the notification, they'll see the information from the person looking to hitchhike&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">u</span><span data-contrast="none">ser Benny</span><span data-contrast="none">82&rsquo;s</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is hitchhiking to Canberra. He's looking for a ride he's willing to compensate $25.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">During the ride, the App shows the driver's destination. If anyone feels unsafe at any time, they can be an emergency button, which they can press to report any abuse against the other users and even put them through to emergency services. Although we want people to have happy, safe trips, I feel&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">it is essential to have an emergency feature. Once the ride has finished, the transaction will occur, and both driver and passenger go in separate directions. If it is</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;a regular commute ride, both users can choose to set up a regular commute trip in the App.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p><br>
