            <h1>Individual Reflections<h1>
              <h3>Team Member 1</h3>
    <p>Initially, I wasn't looking forward to working in a group. I like to work autonomously more often than not, and be able to just get tasks completed at my own efficient pace. What I learned during this exercise, was that it was actually a great experience and working in a team provided support and comradery. We had a common goal and none of us wanted to let the others down. Even when one of our team members suddenly left without notice or explanation, the rest of team rallied together by shifting focus and this allowed us to came together and get the shortfall completed in time and not just that, completed to a high quality. We did our best to share the tasks to ensure we all contributed the best we could. We worked within the bounds of our individual available times, some members even worked beyond that time.  
              <p>What I found difficult was getting enthusiastic about a project idea that I wasn't passionate about. It made me think about future projects in the real world and needing to get used to the fact that there will be other jobs that might not match my values, so that will be interesting. What surprised me most about working in a team, was how much I enjoyed it. Coordinating the team and keeping the project on track was quite satisfying. What I think I need to improve on is being able to step away from each aspect of the project to avoid inadvertently making others work seem undervalued. That is never my intention but sometimes it can be perceived as such. My aim was only to get the team through the requirements of the assignment brief to ensure we presented a high standard of work at the end. Overall, it was a great experience and I think we all learned from one another and this made our team strong and efficient. It was made easier due to the fact that each team member was an absolute legend.</p>
              <h3>Team Member 2</h3>
    <p>Overall, our group project was very successful even though we had some unexpected challenges to overcome. Everybody participated equally towards our work and we had very well organised group meetings with appropriate feedback. I think each member of the team produced high-quality work with regards to time management, research, and writing. 
Some of the members, including myself, occasionally missed due dates on their assigned group tasks but it did not affect the critical path of the project.  This is an area that could be improved for better group performance in assignment 3. 
Unfortunately, one of our members suddenly withdrew from the group which caused mild frustration for our project. However, quick changes to our schedule and adjustment of our plans successfully meant that our team was able to keep ourselves on track. 
It was a valuable experience for me in learning how to cooperate as a team. I learned that individual responsibility is crucial when working with others to achieve common goals. Moreover, I realised the importance of time management because it could significantly affect overall team performance. To conclude, I am satisfied with what we have achieved so far and I am looking forward to more improvement in our next group project. 
    </p>
              <h3>Team Member 3</h3>
    <p>When we first decided on a name for our Team -  One Team One Dream Tech, I did not have any idea of what that name would come to signify for our Team as a whole. I was also reluctant to join a Team. It's daunting to begin to work with people you have no prior working knowledge of. It is difficult to keep project schedules on track when we all have such busy lives. To say I am pleased with the work we have done together is an understatement. Every single member of our group was willing to work very hard to try to work on our project even if they did not have much knowledge working with the subject before we started the group. Honestly, the only thing I think I personally struggled with was working with GitHub. I need to improve my usage of GitHub so I can work more effectively in our Team when it comes to building our website. I was also genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed using MS Teams for our meetings. It is a very effective tool and at the start of our meetings in Week One I found it very difficult to speak up but now feel much more comfortable and enjoy contributing to our meetings. I am very proud of our Team and cannot wait to see what is next in store for us.</p>
              </p>
              <h3>Team Member 4</h3>
    <p><p>I'm used to working within a group. I do it professionally, and when a team works together, it can accomplish anything. And that has been the case since day one for this team. When we all met through the course, we clicked straight away, and the very first thing we accomplished as a team was naming ourselves. We chose the perfect name, "One team, one dream tech". And that's where we started our journey together. We all had different skill sets, strengths and weaknesses. We all helped and encouraged each other, and when someone was unsure of their ability, the others would mentor them and help step them through what they could improve on and what they needed to learn. This was very apparent when one of our team members left the course without notice, who we were all relying on to accomplish their part of the assignment. The rest of us all pulled together and put backup plans in place. We all took on extra work to make up for the shortfall, ensuring everyone felt supported and not overwhelmed. We had great leadership, direction and decision-making, which has led us to execute a high-quality assignment on time. We were lucky to find each other, and we have all worked hard together to achieve our goals.</p>
              <h3>Team Member 5</h3>
    <p>A lot of times the data collecting process has been stressful, and sometimes precarious, I learned to be resilient in, and how to maintain focus on meeting my set objectives. Concurrently, I also learned when to change approaches in this project, especially when a particular research method had proven to be unsuccessful.
The whole process was really challenging one that introduced me to the iterative nature of fieldwork. With it being obvious to me that in the real world, nothing ever goes as neatly as planned on paper. I also found out how imperative both resilience and flexibility was in the team. I would have prepared back-up alternatives for each aspect of my study, since in some cases I was completely thrown off guard and had to take a couple of extra hours to relax and pull myself back. I lost a few valuable hours by doing this and if I had managed my expectations with more caution, I believe I would have been better prepared for the unexpected occurrences in this project.</p>

              <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
    <p>We feel that all of the OTOD Tech team members worked well together and worked hard to get our assignment completed on time. We demonstrated good organisational skills, time management and communication. This included establishing our group early, creating a detailed 'Group Project Schedule' (Gantt Chart), and assigning tasks via MS Teams' Task Planner. This allowed each team member to know what their role was and what to focus on. When we needed to make a decision, we all submitted our suggestions and used Microsoft forms to narrow down the options to the perfect choice. We made sure to set attainable deadlines and checked the status during each of our meetings. Our overall deadline was set a week prior to the submission date to give us all enough time to review and make any last minute's updates. Another lesson to come out of this, was how effective it was not to rush into a task, instead, spend some time evaluating the issue with the team before moving ahead. The links provided in the Tools & Audit Trail section below demonstrates an accurate overview of how our team worked and how much each individual member contributed.</p>
<p><strong>What could be improved</strong></p>
<p>If we could have had an extra team member to replace the one that left, then it may have improved the amount of time we had to focus on each part of the assignment, improving the overall outcome. Another important aspect that may have been overlooked, was remembering to acknowledge and support the different levels of English comprehension as this may have resulted in moments of misunderstanding. Going forward, our team will be more aware.</p>
<p><strong>At least one thing that was surprising.</strong></p>
<p>Most of our team members were apprehensive about working together in a group because the vast majority of us were used to working independently and only relying on ourselves to complete our projects. But what we discovered early on was that by working together as a team and by combining our strengths and being aware of our weaknesses, that not only did we have an effective team, but a really great one. Each one of us now genuinely looks forward to working together.</p>
<p><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</strong></p>
         <p>Working together as a team demonstrated to us what Aristotle once said,<em>"The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts"</em>. It became clear to us that working as a team created synergy and momentum. We realised that the group, itself 'OTOD-Tech', had developed an identity that had become so much more than the sum of its parts, or the people's individual talents within it.</p>
              <p>We've tried to think of what didn't work, what the negatives were, but we were all lucky to have the abilities and maturity to communicate and work well as an efficient and cohesive team. It may be because we all had the same dream.</p>
              <p>As a team, we used a online form to poll each member's contribution, to make it fair and give us all an idea of what each of us was thinking. The results are below:</p>

                   <h1>Tools & Audit Trail</h1>
                 <h3>GitHub</h3>
              <p>The GitHub audit trail is a true reflection of our teams work efforts. Though the commit history is subjective, as it depends on what the commits represents, i.e. one member making many mistakes or one member adding quality code? Either way, we were all still learning to strengthen our commit processes and our way around GitHub in general. Some team member's were more confident with it but having other members less confident resulted in apprehension and sometimes errors, but it was all a learning curve which we managed to overcome to a point, and eventually found our groove resulting in what we believe to be a very successful website and something we were all proud to be part of.</p>
              <p>Do we all now love GitHub after this experience? The jury is still it out.</p>

                </ul>
              <p>We found MS Teams the perfect tool to manage and coordinate our team. It provided a Task Planner which we transferred all of our Group Schedule (Gantt Chart) tasks into and assigned each task to members of the team. These were tracked with due dates and followed up during our meetings. Some team members had little experience with Teams but did an amazing job to get up to speed and appreciate the features of the program.</p>

              <p>Our Team consisted of the following channels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>General</li>
                 <li>GitHub and Website</li>
                 <li>Interesting Leaning Links</li>
                 <li>Meetings</li>
                 <li>Project Brainstorming</li>
                 <li>Project Management</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This made it easier to find relevant chat threads and other information relating to the specific area of our project.</p>

<p>Our online meetings were successful and without too many connectivity issues. We were able to easily share our screens, swap control and record. The recordings were easy to store as well as all of the other documents required to complete our project.</p>

<p>Below are two of the tracking charts from the Task Planner. These are a true representation of the contributions of each team member:</p>
