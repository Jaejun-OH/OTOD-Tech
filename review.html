            <h1>Individual Reflections<h1>
              <h3>Team Member 1</h3>
    <p>Initially, I wasn't looking forward to working in a group. I like to work autonomously more often than not, and be able to just get tasks completed at my own efficient pace. What I learned during this exercise, was that it was actually a great experience and working in a team provided support and comradery. We had a common goal and none of us wanted to let the others down. Even when one of our team members suddenly left without notice or explanation, the rest of team rallied together by shifting focus and this allowed us to came together and get the shortfall completed in time and not just that, completed to a high quality.</p>
    <p>What surprised me most about working in a team, was how much I enjoyed it. Coordinating the team and keeping the project on track was quite satisfying. It was made easier due to the fact that each team member was an absolute legend.</p>
        <p>We did our best to share the tasks to ensure we all contributed the best we could. We worked within the bounds of our individual available times, some members even worked beyond that time. Overall, it was a great experience and I think we all learned from one another and this made our team strong and efficient.</p>
              <h3>Team Member 2</h3>
    <p>Overall, our group project was very successful even though we had some unexpected challenges to overcome. Everybody participated equally towards our work and we had very well organised group meetings with appropriate feedback. I think each member of the team produced high-quality work with regards to time management, research, and writing. 
Some of the members, including myself, occasionally missed due dates on their assigned group tasks but it did not affect the critical path of the project.  This is an area that could be improved for better group performance in assignment 3. 
Unfortunately, one of our members suddenly withdrew from the group which caused mild frustration for our project. However, quick changes to our schedule and adjustment of our plans successfully meant that our team was able to keep ourselves on track. 
It was a valuable experience for me in learning how to cooperate as a team. I learned that individual responsibility is crucial when working with others to achieve common goals. Moreover, I realised the importance of time management because it could significantly affect overall team performance. To conclude, I am satisfied with what we have achieved so far and I am looking forward to more improvement in our next group project.

              <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
    <p>We feel that all of the members of the OTOD Tech team worked well together and worked hard to get our assignment completed on time. We demonstrated good organisational skills, time management and communication. This included establishing our group early, creating a detailed 'Group Project Schedule' (Gantt Chart), and assigning tasks via MS Teams' Task Planner. This allowed each team member to know what their role was and what to focus on. We made sure to set attainable deadlines and checked the status during each of our meetings. Our overall deadline was set a week prior to the submission date to give us all enough time to review and make any last minutes updates.The links provided in the Tools & Audit Trail section below, demonstrates a true overview of how our team worked and how much each individual member contributed.</p>
