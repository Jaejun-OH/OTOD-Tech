            <h1>Autonomous Vehicles (AV)</h1>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles (AV) also referred to as driverless cars, are able to sense the surrounding environment and navigate safely with little to no human intervention. They rely on sensors, complex algorithms, actuators (component of a machine that is responsible for movement and control of the car), powerful processors and machine learning systems. These cars are able to be in full control with or without a human passenger.</p>
            <p>These cars contain a variety of sensors located throughout the different parts of the vehicle. This includes video cameras to detect traffic lights, track other vehicles, understand road signs and most importantly, look out for pedestrians. They utilise radar sensors to monitor nearby vehicles. Lidar sensors (light detection and ranging sensors) indicates and measures distance, detect road edges and lane markings by bouncing light off the car’s surroundings. The detection of curbs and other cars when parking occur via the ultrasonic sensors inside of the wheels.</p>
            <p>Advanced software then processes all of the sensory input, plots a journey, and sends the instructions to the actuators which controls steering, braking and acceleration. The car then follows traffic rules and navigates obstacles through an intricate set of hard-coded rules, predictive modelling, object recognition and obstacle avoidance algorithms.</p>
            <p>Though some may be intrigued and excited about owning a fully autonomous car, several countries are still testing the reliability and safety of them. Some of the top challenges seem to be environmental, philosophical and legislative.  So, they won’t be available to the general public for a number of years yet.</p>
            <p>Some of the unknowns include, weather conditions such as heavy rains and snow and the effects on camera visibility and reliability of the sensors to track lane markings. Potential issues regarding the expense of Lidar, and will other autonomous cars travelling on the same road interfere with the lidar signals.  Will travelling through tunnels and over bridges be an issue?  What about bumper to bumper traffic?  Can the autonomous car regulate correctly?  Then there is the question around accident liability, who is at fault? The manufacturer? The human passenger? Another concern is the difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence when it comes to the subtle cues and life-saving instincts that humans may have over a machine.</p>
            <p>As of 2021, there are no companies that offer a fully autonomous car to the public. There are companies introducing very limited technologies for public accessibility such as sophisticated cruise control systems, and then there are companies that have managed to introduce almost autonomous technology, but under extremely restricted circumstances, such as shuttle buses on college campuses.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Some of the big car companies have disputed some of the technology that makes up the autonomous vehicle such as the lidar sensors, but technology that is not in dispute is machine learning and AI. Most companies have constructed a simulation environment – a virtual city as it were – to run their cars through and quickly test rare scenarios or hardware tweaks. Think of it as Tron meets calculus homework. Any company who has built such a simulation has invariably run many more “miles” inside the virtual world than in the real one. What enables these simulations to be so valuable is incredibly detailed mapping of intersections, routes, and even whole cities. (Kaslikowski 2019)</p>
            <p>There are different levels of autonomous vehicles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Level 1 since 1950, provides computer assistance for simple driver functions e.g. ABS, cruise control, Stability Control).
            </li>
              <li>Level 2 since 2000, provides partial automation of one feature at a time e.g. automatic emergency breaking AEB.
            </li>
               <li>Level 3 available now, provides two or more simultaneous functions e.g. cruise control and lane keeping.
            </li>
              <li>Level 4 is in testing and will result in most driving functions being automated with the need for human intervention only in unusual circumstances. This automation will allow drivers to read and relax during their journeys.
            </li>
              <li>Level 5 from 2060+ and will be fully autonomous. All driving functions will be fully computer controlled with absolutely no human intervention. Not even a steering wheel. The driver could sleep during their journey.
            </li>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">The scenarios for convenience and quality-of-life improvements are limitless. The elderly and the physically disabled would have independence. If your kids were at summer camp and forgot their bathing suits and toothbrushes, the car could bring them the missing items. You could even send your dog to a veterinary appointment. But the real promise of autonomous cars is the potential for dramatically lowering CO2 emissions. (Synopsys 2019)</p>
            <p>The Three Revolutions in Urban Transportation study produced by the University of California, Davis, and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, concluded that if society adopts electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and ride sharing concurrently by 2050, this could lower the CO2 from 4,600 megatonnes to 500 megatonnes per year. That’s an 80% cut in emissions worldwide.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that the introduction of fully autonomous vehicles will have a major economic impact and affect many industries, not just the automotive industry. The following industries are set to be impacted one way or another; Personal travel, Public sector, Real Estate, Energy suppliers, Healthcare, Freight, Insurance, Telecommunications, just to name a few. Within each of the mentioned industries, there is a wide range of jobs that may prosper and some that will decline or cease completely. That means potentially high unemployment rates but also the opportunities for upskilling to keep up with the inevitable changes coming our way in the technology sectors. Some obvious contenders of being made redundant by autonomous cars are independent taxi services, Lyft and Uber drivers even regional flights may become a less favoured option due to the availability of hiring or buying an AV to drive you without the hassle of parking, checking in, security etc.</p>
           <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Just like the computer, and the car before that, autonomous vehicles will send substantial and numerous shock waves through the world economy. You would be hard pressed to find an industry that will not be impacted (for good or for bad) by autonomous vehicles. Importantly, the economic impacts of the autonomous car will be magnified and accelerated by two parallel innovations: the electric car and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS). Each of these technologies is important and significant on its own. But together these technologies create a virtuous cycle the will expand their respective impact far beyond anything that would be achieved on their own. (Economic Impact 2018). </p>
            <p>Personally, having access to a fully autonomous car would be life-changing. The convenience of being driven through peak-hour traffic and only having to focus on finishing my book or study, would result in a stress-free journey. I will save time as there will be no need to worry about finding a car park. The option of being driven interstate to see my family, subject to available infrastructure, instead of getting on a plane, with the ability to sleep all the way there, would be brilliant. These types of cars would help my elderly family members and friends and eventually myself, to keep our independence in our aging years.</p>
            <p>Having said all that, I wouldn’t use an autonomous car until they had been cleared as 100% reliable and safe. With so much computerisation involved, they are susceptible to hacking and malfunction. If I had the choice between a Level 5, fully automated with no access to a steering wheel and a Level 4, most functions automated except under unusual circumstances, I would choose Level 4, as I don’t completely trust the way the world is heading in relation to the advancements in technology. I feel like it is about to supersede the need for humans in every sector. Sometimes it’s important to stop and look around at what we’ve got before it’s gone forever.</p>
