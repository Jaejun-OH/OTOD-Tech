              <br>
              <p style="font-size: 75%">Common Elements</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">As the world evolves to embrace the new industrial revolution, our workplaces are changing. Just as other industrial revolutions transformed the skillset and experience required from the workforce, we can expect the same from this revolution. Only five years from now, 35 percent of the skills seen as essential today will change according to the Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Tech).</p>

               <p style="font-size: 75%">Difference in Ideal Jobs</p>

               <center><img src="img/ideal1.gif" alt="AV" width="460" height="345"></center>

               <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">I have differentiated each of our group ideal jobs in IT into (3) three similarly common jobs. (Based on Top Burning Glass Occupations)</p>

               <p>1.Programmers</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Computer programmers are the brains behind software functions they write and test the code that makes up software programs. This might range from simple computer games or word processors all the way up to complicated operating systems and database management systems.</p><br>

              <p>2.Technical Support</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Tech Support typically handles both hardware and software issues at the user level, helping the less tech-savvy with their computer problems making communication skills, problem solving, and well-rounded tech knowledge an asset.</p><br>

              <p>3.Computer System Analyst</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Computer systems analysts are the multitaskers of information technology. They must understand computer hardware, software, and networks and how they all come to work together. This job requires a multitude of different skills, including the ability to analyse information quickly and effectively, excellent communication, and the ability to persuade when necessary.</p>

               <p style="font-size: 75%">Career Plans</p>

               <center><img src="img/ideal2.gif" alt="AV" width="560" height="445"></center>

               <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">It is good to know the different career streams available in IT industry to have a complete understanding of the roles and required skill for our ideal jobs. Each job has a distinctive set of required skills and personal traits. Almost all IT jobs depend on strong technical knowledge. But each has a different emphasis, whether the job centres on coding, managing hardware, applying software, data science or managing systems or people.</p>

               <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Our career plans align on many roles in the information technology sector that involve working within a collaborative team environment, so the ability to maintain positive work relationships and participate in group-oriented projects is a must in this field. Of course, being able to think innovatively and creatively to come up with solutions is another valued skill.</p><br>
